*Writers notes are in itallics*

- Network visualizations are good for showcasing how systems work because they show how things are related. 
- They represent data better than other, flatter, types of visualizations

## Some basic terminology
Networks (also called graphs) are made out of:

- **Nodes**: The things that are being connected (the academic staff, for example)
- **Links**: The connections between them (the works the nodes have in common)

- Networks can also help discover and display patterns
- Networks present the posibility of many-to-many connections. *This is useful because that is exactly what we're trying to represent with the graph*
